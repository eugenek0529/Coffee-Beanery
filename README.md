# Coffee Beanery 
### Frontend only project (React + Tailwind)
View Project: https://eugenek0529.github.io/Coffee-Beanery/ 


Coffee Beanery is a single-page website concept for an imaginary caf√©, created to practice frontend development skills. Built using React and Tailwind CSS, this project helped me explore single-page application architecture and master responsive design with Tailwind's utility-first approach.
